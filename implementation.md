#Implementation

We understand that development time is incredibly important and needs to be spend wisely. This is exactly why Stark is aimed at rapid adoption and implementation into any existing workflow.

Prior to considering implementing Stark, it is advised that the previous sections of the document are reviewed and understood in order to expedite the adoption process. Stark's purpose statment and process objectives are a good place to start in getting a quick rundown of the process overall.

##Environment Rollout

Once commited to adopting Stark, an environment rollout will need to take place.

Since Stark relies on Git, hosting for team repositories must be set up. This may be done in any fashion, although local Git implementations with backup redundancy would prove to be the most secure option, as opposed to utilizing a cloud-based provider. Once the central repos have been set up, each developer will need to have a copy of Git installed on his machine, at the very least. It is advised to look into various GUI frontends for Git, as this will reduce the learning curve for developers and speed up the overall adoption process.

##Environment Training

If Git is a new tool in the company workflow all developers will need to be trained on how to use it. While many of its more advanced features can be picked up over time, laying a solid foundation with the basic knowledge of Git will go a long way in overcoming the initial productivity bump.

##Responsibility Allocation

Developers need to be aware of their personal responsibilities so that they can follow them. Have each developer review the 'Responsibilities' section and encourage them to voice any questions or concerns that may arise after reading through the document.
