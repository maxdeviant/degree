#Overview

Stark aims to be the process of choice for developers looking for a clear and low-hassle approach to software development. Clear, common-sense principles combined with deep Git integration creates a compelling workflow to write code in.

#Principles
>"Rules are not necessarily sacred, principles are." – Franklin D. Roosevelt

##1. Commit early, commit often.

This adage – borrowed from Git – is ingrained heavily in the Stark process. Commits cost nothing to make, which means there is no excuse for not committing on a regular basis. A habit of committing after adding or changing any piece of code makes it simple to track changes over a longer period.

##2. Code over comments.

Documentation and comments have their place in code, and go a long way in enabling other developers to easily understand the interactions of a particular subroutine or complex logic gate. However, comments should not be prioritized when working on a new feature. No reason in writing perfectly good comments that will be scrapped before a merge.

##3. Branch out.

Do not commit to master. That's an order! All major changes start with a branch. Name it something intelligent, such as the feature being added. Once a branch is created, use commits to manage small changes within the branch. And if the implentation of a sub-feature may end up being incredibly messy, make a seperate branch for that as well. Much like commits, branches are free: use them.

##4. Keep it clean.

No one wants to look at messy code. Ensure that all code is properly formatted, documented, and commented before any and all code reviews. This will make the review process easier, as well as making the reviewed code merge-ready at the end of the review.

#Planning
>"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." – Dwight D. Eisenhower

##1. Plan your work.

Planning should be the first task in every software iteration.

##2. Work your plan.

#Roles

##King

The highest position in Stark is that of the king. The king is responsible for all executive decisions in the development process and is responsible for working closely with marketing and business teams, as well as shareholders and users.

##Hand of the King

The Hand of the King (Hand) is second in command on the development team. The Hand is responsible for making critical decisions on the king's behalf. This frees up the hierarchy and prevents the king from being too overwhelmed with managerial tasks. This also enables development to continue even in the king's absence. 

##Small Council

The small council is chaired by the king, Hand, as well as key individuals from the development team. The small council is responsible for discussing any issues or concerns that have arisen during the course of development. It is advised that the small council meet regularly for maximum efficiency.
