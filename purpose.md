#Purpose
>"Your purpose in life is to find your purpose and give your whole heart and soul to it." â€“ Buddha

In a landscape filled with numerous software development processes, it is often hard to settle upon one to use. Each process will claim to increase productivity, quality, and security in the software development cycle, but there are few processes which really show how they will achieve that without investing weeks and months into adopting the new process.

This is where Stark comes in. Born out of necessity, Stark aims to be as transparent as possible to enable potential adopters to know what they are getting without wasting any production time.

Founded on Scrum, which we believe to be one of the most complete processes to date, Stark places additional emphasis on security in the development process, something which Scrum tends to gloss over. What this means for adopters is short iteration times and incremental improvements to software packages.

Another key component of Stark is integrated source control. Harnessing the power of Git, Stark aims to keep the development process as versatile as possible while still maintaining a neat codebase.
