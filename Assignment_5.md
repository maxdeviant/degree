#Activity Report

##Completed

So far I have conducted most of my research, which took a bit longer than I originally anticipated. I started off searching with Google Scholar. I had never used the engine before, nor even heard of it before this assignment, but since I was planning on using the vanilla Google search engine to turn up results for this report anyways, I figured that the more scholarly of the two would not be harmful to try.!However, after entering some very broad terms such as ‘computer security’ and ‘phishing,’ most or all of the results required payment to view. Whether they be journals, magazine articles, or published research papers, most of the results had a fee attached to them.!With Google Scholar being a bit of a flop, I turned to the West Chester University Library site for my research needs. While there was a wealth of results available, many of the results were noticeably dated, five or more years old. With a topic covering something that changes in the blink of an eye more modern results are required. However, these older articles will lay the groundwork for the background of internet phishing, which dates back almost as far as computers themselves.!We have also been reading a number of articles pertaining to my topic in my Intro to Computer Security class, so I considered a few of the articles that were made available to me for that class for inclusion in my report, as they are digitized copies of magazine and journal articles. Again, these articles tend to be on the older side, but the information in some of them is still quite relevant and could potentially be used.!I was also able to find a recent article from the Wall Street Journal on the subject of internet phishing through a quick Google search. These sources provide a more relevant look at the topic, however they often lack the depth of a journal article.

##In Progress

With the research taking longer to lock down, the completed bibliography page originally slated for completion this past Friday has been bumped to later this week, depending on my schedule with other classes. Having it finalized around Wednesday should give me plenty of time to revise any other items that need to be addressed before the rough draft is due next Monday.

##Looking Ahead

I have been giving a little bit of thought to the safety brochure that I mentioned before, but as the deadline draws nearer I will need to start doing some more active planning for document design. Things like page layout, graphics, and the flow of information all need to be considered when translating from a more traditional risk report to a brochure format.!Overall, I would say that I am on track, aside from the small hiccups in the research process. I look forward to putting the final deliverable together in the near future.
