##Objectives

####Primary Responsibilites
It is the responsibility of each team member to ensure that they are completing thier goals by the end of each iteration. To help speed up completion development team members should complete all tasks that they take on as quickly as possible (without sacrificing quality of course) and then offer assistance to other team members. This does not mean take over that task completely, but rather offer ideas and help the team member find solutions to problems.

####Project Planning and Commits
One of the main goals for using the Stark Process is to ensure that the development team is cooperating in a fashion that accelerates the completion of the project. Ensuring that everyone on the team is aware of what the other members are working on and when they are expected to finish. Sticking to the schedule set at team and goal setting meetings should be taken very seriously in order to ensure that the project is completed in  timely fashion. By giving each goal an estimated cost and completion time, the customer is able to see how thier project is developing rather than blindly trusting the developers or setting a completion date that may be unrealistic.

The Stark Process wants to make sure that the customer is always involved with the project. By giving the customer full access to the development of the project, the customer can quickly and easily express concerns or changes they have about the project. This allows less time spent developing features that the customer wants changed and allows for a fast flexible work environment that can accomidate the customer's wishes quickly and efficiently.
