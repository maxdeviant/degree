#2. Objectives

Stark aims to help shape good teamwork habits for developers working on group projects. Rather than force developers into a defined method of doing things, Stark lays a framework to guide them into important habits that are easily applied in practice and transferrable from project to project. The following objectives outline the suggested habits for developers that will increase the overall stability of the development process.

##Process Script
Planning||
---:|---
1| King is is chosen
2| Establish methods of communication
3| Create goals and completion time for sprint
4| Divide tasks
5| Begin iterating on software package
6| Check all code for compliance
7| Repeat steps 3-7 until completion

Design||
---:|---
1| Develop working code
2| Implement security aspects
3| Fix bugs/errors that occur
4| Refactor code

Implementation||
---:|---
1| Coding standards are agreed upon by the team
2| Code is written individually or in pairs depending on the level of the programmer
3| Code is inspected to ensure that the content meets the standard requirements
4| Code is reviewed: Developer makes a review checklist, error tacking log, and code inspection script for each week

Quality Assurance||
---:|---
1| Quality assurance team will be established
2| Unit tests will be documented. Each test will contain the intended functionality of the design based on the iteration and ser goals
3| Security Analyst involvement: performs tests halfway through and at the end of each iteration
4| Customer Involvement: Customer will be consulted at the end of each iteration to ensure the project is moving in the direction they desire
5| Produce the final product that contains the least amount of errors possible and is cost efficient to the consumer

|Process Modification||
---:|---
|| Quality Assurance team will determine if process needs modifications based off feedback from the development team, management, data assessment, and SEI Input|
1| Development teams and management will record written concerns about current process and changes to process will be recorded|
2| Data Assessment - examins the tends pertaining to time-till-completion and defect injection/removal |
3| SEI Input follows any changes enforced by the Institute|
