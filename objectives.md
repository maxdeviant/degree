#2. Objectives
>"We all enjoy pushing ourselves to accomplish our objectives. But we don't need stress to get there." â€“ Andrew Bernstein

Stark aims to help shape good teamwork habits for developers working on group projects. Rather than force developers into a defined method of doing things, Stark lays a framework to guide them into important habits that are easily applied in practice and transferrable from project to project. The following objectives outline the suggested habits for developers that will increase the overall stability of the development process.

##Process Script
Project Planning||
---:|---
1| King is chosen
2| Communication channels are established
3| Goals and deadline for sprint are decided
4| Tasks are divided up
5| Iteration begins
6| Check all code for compliance
7| Repeat steps 3-7 until completion of project

=====

Design||
---:|---
1| Develop working code
2| Implement security aspects
3| Fix bugs/errors that occur
4| Refactor code

=====

Implementation||
---:|---
1| Coding standards are agreed upon by the team
2| Code is written to adhere to the compliance standards
3| Code is inspected to ensure that the content meets the standard requirements
4| Code is reviewed: Developer prepares unit test logs

=====

Quality Assurance||
---:|---
1| Quality assurance team will be established
2| Unit tests will be documented. Each test will contain the intended functionality of the design based on the iteration and user goals
3| Lord Commander involvement: Performs tests halfway through and at the end of each iteration
4| Client Involvement: Client will be consulted at the end of each iteration to ensure the project is moving in the direction they desire
5| Produce the final product that contains the least amount of errors possible and is cost efficient to the consumer

=====

|Process Modification||
---:|---
|| Small council will determine if process needs modifications based off feedback from the development team, management, and collected data metrics|
1| Development teams and management will record written concerns about current process and changes to process will be recorded|
2| Data Assessment: Examine the trends pertaining to time-till-completion and defect injection/removal |
