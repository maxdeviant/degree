#3. Responsibilities

Stark holds each individual developer to a set of standards. These outline the responsibilities of the developers in their own personal development cycle, as well as members of the development team as a whole.

##Personal Responsibilities

###1. Time Management

Each developer is expected to keep track of the time spent on each task throughout the course of the sprint. This may be done in any way the developer decides is the most comfortable and least interruptive, provided it gives an accurate metric for the time spent during development.

Not only does the collection of time metrics give an accurate representation of how time is being spent on a per-developer basis, it also breeds a sense of awareness for time in each developer. Taking extended coffee or bathroom breaks suddenly becomes less of an issue when developers are mindful of the time they spend on each task throughout the day and are proactive about staying on point during working hours.

The Appendix contains a sample time management sheet that may be used as an example when devising methods to keep trap of time. This sample document is intended to be filled out over the course of the day, with the developer filling in start and end times for different tasks and accounting for periods of distraction time.

###2. Communication

Each developer is expected to be in communcation with those around them. While this communication does not have to be constant, it is always good for team leaders and other colleagues to be kept in the loop throughout the course of the sprint.

It is often tempting to not communicate when making good progress or when making slow progess, if any. But communication is key in allowing the Hand and the small council to be aware of how various teams are progressing and if any hangups have been encountered.

###3. Acceptable Conduct

Developers must handle themselves in a manner conducive to a safe and productive workplace.

Any developer may be suspended on proven or plausible grounds of deplorable behaviors including, but not limited to, racism, sexism, inappropriate comments, theft, physical or sexual assault, etc.

Maintaining an environment of safety and civility amongst coworkers fosters greater productivity. After all, it is extremely hard to get any work done if living in the fear of being harassed in some way by others in the workplace.

###4. Independence

Developers are expected to be largely independent in their work. While the occassional need for assistance is to be expected, developers should not expect to have someone looking over their shoulder at all times.

As a result, developers need to maintain their focus and drive throughout the course of the sprint. This enables managers and other team members to focus on their assigned tasks, rather than having to hound developers to stay focused on theirs.
