#Responsibilities

Stark holds each individual developer to a set of standards. These outline the responsibilities of the developers in their own personal development cycle, as well as members of the development team as a whole.

##Personal Responsibilities

###1. Time management

Each developer is expected to keep track of the time spent on each task throughout the course of the sprint. This may be done in any way the developer decides is the most comfortable and least interruptive, provided it gives an accurate metric for the time spent during development.

The appendix contains a sample time management sheet that may be used as an example when devising methods to keep trap of time.
