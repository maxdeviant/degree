					This report is designed to convey the dangers of internet phishing and to inform readers on how best to protect themselves. A background of phishing will be included, as well as a breakdown of current phishing attacks used to compromise users and which demographic of people have been found to be the most vulnerable to phishing. Finally, this report will also discuss the steps that companies and organizations are taking to protect their users from possible phishing attempts.

					Phishing is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as, "a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information which the scammer can use illicitly." Now, this definition specifically cites emails as the only form of phishing, when in reality this is just the traditional form.Today, phishing can take a variety of forms, but the one element that they all have in common is that the phisher is masquerading as someone they are not. According to computer security expert Zulfikar Ramzan:

				"The last few years has seen a rise in the frequency with which people have conducted meaningful transactions online; from making simple purchases to paying bills to banking, and even getting a mortgage or car loan or paying their taxes. This rise in online transactions has unfortunately been accompanied by a rise in attacks"

				<h3><a id="Hook">Stage One &mdash; Hook</a></h3>
				<div class="section">
					<p>
						The first stage is when the target first receives the phish. The phish is most often an email, claiming to be from a trusted entity, such as a financial institution or a friend. The email will always contain a call to action for the target, with the call to action often being of relative importance and incredibly time sensitive. The email will do its best to convince the reader of its purported legitimacy in order for the second stage to be followed through without hesitation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3><a id="Line">Stage Two &mdash; Line</a></h3>
				<div class="section">
					<p>
						The second stage is when the target acts on the phish. Once this occurs, the target has almost certainly been convinced that the phish is legitimate. It is during this stage that the target makes the transition to victim, as they are now playing into the hands of the phishers. In this step, the now-victim will follow through with the instructions given in stage one.
					</p>
					<p>
						Traditionally, this step is compromised of having the victim reply to the phish with the sensitive information that is being requested, such as account passwords, bank account numbers or PINs, or the answers to account recovery questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						In more advanced phishing attempts, rather than replying to the email directly, as many users have been warned against, the victim will be prompted to go to a website to perform the same task. These websites are carefully constructed to look as similar to their legitimate counterparts as possible, with the differences nigh-invisible to someone not looking for discrepancies on the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the victim has been successfully directed to the page, the phishers will request the same kind of information from the victim, but instead of simply replying to an email, the victim will fill out some form on the site, which will hand over the requested information on submission.
					</p>

				<h3><a id="Sinker">Stage Three &mdash; Sinker</a></h3>
				<div class="section">
					<p>
						Finally, the third stage is the monetization of the phish by the phishers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the victim has handed over their personal information, the phishing attempt is almost a success. All that remains is to make proper use of the acquired credentials. Depending on the nature of the information obtained, phishers can do anything from logging into corresponding accounts, transferring money out of the victim’s account, or even stealing the victim’s identity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the phish reaches this stage, it becomes much more difficult to stop and revert the damage. Credit cards and accounts need to be frozen. Passwords for the compromised services need to be changed, as well as any other passwords which may be the same or similar.
