#Dangers of Phishing

##Overview

This report is designed to convey the dangers of internet phishing and to inform readers on how best to protect themselves. A background of phishing will be included, as well as a breakdown of current phishing attacks used to compromise users. This report will also discuss the steps that companies and organizations are taking to protect their users from possible phishing attempts.

##Phishing

Phishing is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as, “a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information which the scammer can use illicitly.” Now, this definition specifically cites emails as the only form of phishing, when in reality this is just the traditional form.

Today, phishing can take a variety of forms, but the one element that they all have in common is that the phisher is masquerading as someone they are not. According to computer security expert Zulfikar Ramzan:

> “The last few years has seen a rise in the frequency with which people have conducted meaningful transactions online; from making simple purchases to paying bills to banking, and even getting a mortgage or car loan or paying their taxes. This rise in online transactions has unfortunately been accompanied by a rise in attacks”
>

In line with other forms of cyber attacks, phishing has evolved over the years in order to stay relevant to the current trends in computing. This means that phishers, as the attackers are called, are becoming increasingly more crafty in their approaches to compromise user information.

Phishing attacks have become a very attractive exploit for hackers, as they must only be convincing enough to fool a user, rather than having to fool the vast amounts of security and antivirus software safeguarding a computer or network.

A typical phishing attempt consists of three distinct stages.

###Stage One – Hook

The first stage is when the target first receives the phish. The phish is most often an email, claiming to be from a trusted entity, such as a financial institution or a friend. The email will always contain a call to action for the target, with the call to action often being of relative importance and incredibly time sensitive. The email will do its best to convince the reader of its purported legitimacy in order for the second stage to be followed through without hesitation.

###Stage Two – Line

The second stage is when the target acts on the phish. Once this occurs, the target has almost certainly been convinced that the phish is legitimate. It is during this stage that the target makes the transition to victim, as they are now playing into the hands of the phishers. In this step, the now-victim will follow through with the instructions given in stage one.

Traditionally, this step is compromised of having the victim reply to the phish with the sensitive information that is being requested, such as account passwords, bank account numbers or PINs, or the answers to account recovery questions.

In more advanced phishing attempts, rather than replying to the email directly, as many users have been warned against, the victim will be prompted to go to a website to perform the same task. These websites are carefully constructed to look as similar to their legitimate counterparts as possible, with the differences nigh-invisible to someone not looking for discrepancies on the page.

Once the victim has been successfully directed to the page, the phishers will request the same kind of information from the victim, but instead of simply replying to an email, the victim will fill out some form on the site, which will hand over the requested information on submission.

###Stage Three – Sinker

Finally, the third stage is the monetization of the phish by the phishers.

Once the victim has handed over their personal information, the phishing attempt is almost a success. All that remains is to make proper use of the acquired credentials. Depending on the nature of the information obtained, phishers can do anything from logging into corresponding accounts, transferring money out of the victim’s account, or even stealing the victim’s identity.

##Background

The first instance of phishing dates back to September 1995, when phishers began asking users of America Online Inc. (AOL) for their passwords. The attackers would pose as AOL employees and ask the user to reveal their password, which would then be used to compromise the account.

The individuals performing these attacks were using an application called ‘AOHell,’ which would allow the attacker to clear all the messages in a chat room in order to make their messages more prominent, download large files without paying AOL for the bandwidth, and, most dangerously, allow the attacker to pose as an AOL official.

If a user unwittingly handed over their password to a phisher, they would find themselves faced with the attacker changing it, thus locking the account, or even having credit card numbers tied to the account stolen.

##Vulnerability

When broached on the subject of phishing, many people will assure themselves that “it could never happen to me, I’m too smart to fall for that.”

However, phishing has been shown to be effective against all sorts of people for four reasons:

> “First, people tend to judge a website’s 
legitimacy by its “look and feel,” which attackers can easily replicate. Second, many users do not understand or trust the security indicators in web browsers. Third, although some consumers are aware of phishing, this awareness does not reduce their vulnerability or provide useful strategies for identifying phishing attacks. Fourth, the perceived severity of the consequences of phishing does not predict users’ behavior.”

While there are some people who are more adept at resisting phishing than others, it is safe to assume that no one is completely immune to these types of attacks.

##Prevention

As phishing has developed as an ever-increasing problem over the years, corporate entities have begun taking steps to ensure the safety of their users and their personal information.

One method of phishing prevention becoming increasingly more prominent is two-factor authentication. This form of user authentication has existed for a long time in the form of account PINs. When withdrawing money from an ATM or using a debit card, a 4-digit pin is required before the transaction can complete. This way, in order for an account to be compromised, the attacker must have both the card and the PIN.

Other methods of two-factor authentication have been designed specifically for the prevention of phishing. On many financial institution web sites, users now select a unique image that will be displayed at the login screen. If the user does not see their unique image, then they know that the page they are viewing is not legitimate. This prevents phishing attempts in the form of web pages designed to mislead users into thinking they are on the legitimate site that the phisher claims to be representing.

In an article from *The Wall Street Journal,* it was revealed that American Express, Capital One, J.P. Morgan Chase, Barclays PLC, Bank of America, and Citigroup have been buying up institution-specific domain names to use for their websites. A site belonging to Citigroup, for example, would have the web extension `.citi`. A measure like this would protect users further by improving the ability to judge the authenticity of a web site by its extension rather than its appearance.

Currently, phishers can easily replicate existing websites, not only in design, but also all the way down to the web address. Addresses extremely similar to those belonging to the institution in question are available for sale through many internet retailers. An attacker could easily purchase `bankatamerica.com` in order to fool `bankofamerica.com` users who may not be looking at every character in the address bar.

According to James Greenwood, a digital and mobile platform architect at Barclays, 

> "For customers to be duped, someone must be convinced that [the site is] Barclays. It's far more difficult to pose as Barclays if [the phishers] can't be part of the ecosystem that we've created."
>

This comes as retaliation to the vast amount of phishing attempts that have plagued financial institutions in recent years. In 2011 alone, almost fifty-percent of all phishing attacks were targeted at the financial-services industry, says Anti-Phishing Working Group.

However, some banks, namely Wells Fargo, have not bought into this new trend, saying that the investment costs are too high and that they do not want to risk diluting their online brand, `wellsfargo.com`.

##Awareness

No matter what steps are taken by companies to protect their constituents online, these measure are only as effective as the weakest link: the users themselves.

As such, the best option to combat phishing is to work to raise user awareness and online incredulity.
