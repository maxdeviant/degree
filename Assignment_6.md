#Dangers of Phishing

##Overview

This report is designed to convey the dangers of internet phishing and to inform readers on how best to protect themselves.

##Phishing

Phishing is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as, “a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information which the scammer can use illicitly.” Now, this definition specifically cites emails as the only form of phishing, when in reality this is just the traditional form.

Today, phishing can take a variety of forms, but the one element that they all have in common is that the phisher is masquerading as someone they are not. According to computer security expert Zulfikar Ramzan:

>“The last few years has seen a rise in the frequency with which people have conducted meaningful transactions online; from making simple purchases to paying bills to banking, and even getting a mortgage or car loan or paying their taxes. This rise in online transactions has unfortunately been accompanied by a rise in attacks” (*Handbook of Information and Communication Security*).

In line with other forms of cyber attacks, phishing has evolved over the years in order to stay relevant to the current trends in computing. This means that phishers, as the attackers are called, are becoming increasingly more crafty in their approaches to compromise user information.

##Background

The first instance of phishing dates back to September 1995, when phishers began asking users of America Online Inc. (AOL) for their passwords. The attackers would pose as AOL employees and ask the user to reveal their password, which would then be used to compromise the account.

The individuals performing these attacks were using an application called ‘AOHell,’ which would allow the attacker to clear all the messages in a chat room in order to make their messages more prominent, download large files without paying AOL for the bandwidth, and, most dangerously, allow the attacker to pose as an AOL official.

If a user unwittingly handed over their password to a phisher, they would find themselves faced with the attacker changing it, thus locking the account, or even having credit card numbers tied to the account stolen.
