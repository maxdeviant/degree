##Overview

I plan to research the dangers of phishing online and present them in a clear and coherent way to those who are not aware of the issue. Seeing as almost everyone comes into contact with computers in some form every day, I believe that this information will be beneficial to a vast number of people.

##Audience

My audience is anyone who uses computers, but I will specifically target those who are blissfully unaware of the dangers of phishing, or have misconceptions about it. As such, I will try to make the information understandable by a novice computer user while also providing enough information to satisfy readers with a more in-depth knowledge of computing.

##Research
My research will come from a variety sources. I will rely heavily on various technology articles and tech blogs that deal with issues in cybersecurity. However, as a more official source of information, I will also be looking to scholarly publications in the computer security field. Throughout the course of my research I will collect various statistics about phishing, as well as cover current methods of phishing that are especially prominent.

##Documentation

I will be documenting my findings with The Chicago Manual of Style, in line with the IEEE Computer Societyâ€™s Style Guide specifications [1]. Documents will be written using LATEX.##Product

The final product will be an informational piece on the dangers of internet phishing, and what steps individuals can take to protect themselves in the face of these threats. The final product may incorporate a user-friendly deliverable, such as a brochure.
