#GitHub

####Social Coding

Social interaction and programming do not exactly complement each other. Writing code is often a task performed solo, with little to no distractions which may prove disruptive in the coding process. If the tagline “social coding” causes feelings of distress or discomfort, just keep reading. Things are not always as they appear.

##What’s a GitHub?

GitHub is a web service designed for the express purpose of hosting programming projects. Built on top of one of the world’s largest source code management systems, GitHub allows anyone to freely host their code on the central servers. 

These repositories serve as a means of backing up, revising, and sharing code on the site. The version control capabilities found in Git make all of this possible by providing the ability to push code changes to the central repository, create separate branches of existing code to test new features, and much more.

##Version control?

Version control is not quite as complex as it sounds. While Git’s powerful backbone allows for advanced codebase management and manipulation, it is incredibly easy for a beginner to start using Git. Even with little experience, Git still provides the ability to see changes in code between versions on a line-by-line basis.

Many forms of version control exist in today’s programming world. Git, however, has gained a large following due to the reputation of its founder, Linus Torvalds, also the founder of Linux (the free and open-source operating system).

Version control makes managing a code base of any size extremely simple. Git records any changes made to the code at the programmer’s discretion, and each one of these independent versions of the codebase can be revisited at any time.

Having a system of dependable backups frees a programmer from having to worry about fiddling with existing code. If something breaks, then falling back to a working version is just a few terminal commands (or clicks, if you prefer) away.

##Why not straight Git?

While it is possible to use Git independently from GitHub, this would mean missing out on some of GitHub’s core features.

By using Git in conjunction with GitHub, all repositories have their contents stored on the website’s central servers. Even in the event of a local loss of code, the most recent snapshot will still exist in the cloud, preventing a loss of work.

Github also makes coding with others a more manageable task. Any number of collaborators can contribute to a single repository, and Git does the work of keeping track of who is making what changes and keeps each user’s local codebase in sync with the rest.

The coolest feature that GitHub offers, by far, is the ability to share and explore repositories with other users. In line with their slogan, “Social coding,” GitHub allows its users to share their repositories with other users, who are then free to change and contribute to it, creating an ecosystem which fosters creative coding.

Out of this creative coding paradigm, projects such as Homebrew (an OS X package manager), Twitter Bootstrap (a website layout front-end), and Quine Relay (a program which generates its own source code). All of these projects are open source, and open to contribution from anyone.
