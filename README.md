Due Date: Tuesday, October 14
-----------------------------

This is a group programming assignment.

Points: 50

Create the following game of pong in JavaScript (without a game engine), accomplishing these requirements:
* Make a 2-player pong game that is played on one workstation (one keyboard).
* Games should go up to 10.
* The score should be displayed at the top of the screen while the game is in session.
* Include an initial title screen and a winner screen.
* The ball should get faster and faster as the level progresses.

Grading Criteria
----------------
* Completing the above requirements.
* The game should also be as fun as possible. *(Yes, this is subjective!)* But any "clunkiness", or aspects of the game that are not "polished", are worthy of point deductions.
* Documented code.
* Use of a git repository.
* Peer-review of your effort and contribution to the project by your teammates.
* 

UPDATE 10/13/14 Anthony Paparo

I was in the proccess of adding powerups and things of the sort and scrapped it. Pong itself isnt that exciting and the score going all the way to 10 seemed boring ----> no matter what was added, pong to ten slowly was going to be boring. So I made it a constant multiball which seems to end games pretty fast (< 2 mins) and its happening so fast it adds a ton of excitement. I also made it so it never really slows down. It does slow a bit each score enough to let you catch your bearings, but the excitement constantly builds until its over. These days quick rounds of games seems to be ideal. 

Play and let me know what you think. I'll have all day tommorrow if you guys want me to go back and make it differnet. -Anthony
