Due Date: Tuesday, October 14
-----------------------------

This is a group programming assignment.

Points: 50

Create the following game of pong in JavaScript (without a game engine), accomplishing these requirements:
* Make a 2-player pong game that is played on one workstation (one keyboard).
* Games should go up to 10.
* The score should be displayed at the top of the screen while the game is in session.
* Include an initial title screen and a winner screen.
* The ball should get faster and faster as the level progresses.

Grading Criteria
----------------
* Completing the above requirements.
* The game should also be as fun as possible. *(Yes, this is subjective!)* But any "clunkiness", or aspects of the game that are not "polished", are worthy of point deductions.
* Documented code.
* Use of a git repository.
* Peer-review of your effort and contribution to the project by your teammates.
