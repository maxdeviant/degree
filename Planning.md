##Initial Planning

###Project Manager (Hand of the King) is chosen

Depending on the neccessity, at the beginning of the project a project manager is to be selected. Durring the first meeting the development team (small council) will decide if a manager is neccessary or not, and in the case that one is needed, elect a person to fill this role. It is the duty of the Project manager to ensure that all work is completed on time and is do not try to handle too many tasks at once. This individual should be a person that is familiar with the process and is capable of managing workloads and time-estimates for completion. As the main organiser for the team, the project manager should be able to keep the development team is following the proper guidelines and is comfortable going to the manager with any questons or concerns they might have.

In addition to managing workloads, the project manager is also responsible for keeping the project on schedule. At the end of every iteration the Project Manager should collect progress forms and backlogs stating what tasks were completed and when. Using these logs, the Manager should adjust the 

In the case that The Hand does not satisfy the requirements, then the small council will convene and reach a majority vote whether or not the hand should be replaced. Should this occur, the Hand will be executed and replaced with a more suitable paw...I mean member.

###Form the Small Council

With assistance of the King and the Hand, the Small council is formed. The council will consist of both the development team as well as members from other areas of the company. The council is present, alongside the King and the Hand, when meeting with the client during the inital planning session.

###Meet with the Client

The client is brought in to discuss the project. This meeting helps the King and the Hand fill the feature backlog and allows the client to convey everything they expect out of the final product. During this meeting, the program's overall design will be laid out, so that a structure of the program is available during sprint meetings when features are being discussed. The client will also discuss who their userbase is, so that the application can be designed with its users in mind.

###Consult with Kingsguard on Security

After the program has been designed and discussed thoroughly, the Kingsguard is then consulted on security aspects. The discussion includes who the program is intended for and what features are expected to be implemented. This gives the developers a chance at catching flaws before they're made, and lightens the load that is placed on the both the kingsguard and QA teams.
