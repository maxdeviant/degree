>"It is easy to be wise after the event." – Arthur Conan Doyle

At the end of each iteration, some time should be allotted for debriefing team members and the client on the completed iteration.

An emphasis should be placed on time management and a general assessment for how well each developer performs his task in the time allotted. Through the use of the time management sheets – assuming they have been filled out diligently – an accurate picture of each developer's tasks during the iteration can be seen.

Durring debriefing, team members should discuss what they have done durring the past iteration. This may be for explaining how (s)he found/fixed an error in code, what they have actually completed, or whether they consider the task complete or not. Team members should avoid directly going over code, unless there is an issue that is trying to be corrected, as all code should be properly documneted by the developer durring the development stage.

Developers should be comfortable explaining why some features were implemented the way they were, but should not be required to explain the entire process. The purpose of the debriefing period should be used to explain to the rest of the team what that individual did durring the last iteration. The use of this time should be spent to clearly list what each member feels is working and is ready to be presented to the customer, or to give a report on the progress for a task that might not yet be ready. In addition the Project Manager should keep a log of all debriefs for each member.

After every member has been debriefed, the Project Manager should then move on to planning the next iteration.
