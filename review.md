>"It is easy to be wise after the event." – Arthur Conan Doyle

At the end of each iteration, some time should be allotted for debriefing team members on the completed iteration.

An emphasis should be placed on time management and a general assessment for how well each developer performs his task in the time allotted. Through the use of the time management sheets – assuming they have been filled out diligently – an accurate picture of each developer's tasks during the iteration can be seen.

During debriefing, team members should discuss the work completed during the past iteration. This may be for explaining how he found and/or fixed an error in code, what they have actually completed, or whether they consider the task complete or not. Team members should avoid directly going over code, unless there is an issue that is trying to be corrected, as all code should be properly documneted by the developer during the development stage.

Developers should be comfortable explaining why some features were implemented the way they were, but should not be required to explain the entire process. The purpose of the debriefing period should be used to explain to the rest of the team what that individual did during the last iteration. The use of this time should be spent to clearly list what each member feels is working and is ready to be presented to the customer, or to give a report on the progress for a task that might not yet be ready. In addition the small council should keep a log of all debriefs for each member.

Debriefing should also cover any concerns relating to Stark itself. Some aspects of the process, while created to be as general and extensible as possible, may not work for all situations. In these circumstances, it is possible to modify Stark to achieve desired results.

After every team member has been debriefed, the small council should go about modifying Stark to fit any concerns that were brought up before moving on to planning the next iteration.
