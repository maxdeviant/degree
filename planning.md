##Project Planning

###King and Hand Selection

The beginning of each project will always begin with the selection of the king and the Hand. This is a crucial first step as it will set the tone for the rest of the project based on the nature of the selections.

There are many factors to consider when selecting inviduals to fill these two extremely powerful positions. Familiarity with the technology that is to be used in the project, leadership and managerial skills, as well as personality, charisma, and motivation are all factors that could make or break the power embodied in the king and the hand.

Senior developers are often a good choice for the position of king, as it is his job to make clutch calls and tough decisions, something that a younger and less experienced developer may not be able to do. Even without a great deal of expertise on certain newer technologies, senior developers are always a valuable asset in this position, as their years of experience still carry a lot of clout on the small council and the development team.

Conversely, the Hand is much more suited to have a younger developer fill the position. Choosing an invidual with fresh knowledge and experience with the technologies being used may ultimately prove valuable.

Additionally, due to the cooperative nature of these two roles, any skill or characteristic that either the king or the Hand lacks will ideally be embodied by the other, allowing a mutual partnership in chairing the small council and development team.

###Small Council Forming

With assistance from the king and the Hand, the small council is formed. The council will consist of key members of the development team as well as members from other areas of the company. Just like when choosing the king and Hand, it is important to think carefully about the inviduals being placed on the council.

A good mix of diverse backgrounds and opinions will go a long way in ensuring the balance of power during the development process. Giving the king and Hand too much power, while not exactly disasterous in most cases, may prove to exacerbate oversights in the development process.

Naturally, it is a good idea to include inviduals from the development team itself, as these members will be acutely aware of any issues or concerns as they arise during the development process. By allowing these items to be noticed sooner rather than later, a more proactive approach to development is taken, rather than a reactive approach.

The council is present, alongside the king and the Hand, when meeting with the client during the inital planning session.

###Client Meeting

At this time, the client will meet with the small council to determine project specifications.

This process may include potential users of the software, as this is the time to develop user stories, if desired. If not, then it is up to the client to articulate what the end product is expected to look like, and how it is expected to behave.

This behavior shall then be converted into features that comprise the software package. Sorting these features into related groups will help create a logical flow for development and aid in developing a timeline.

Based on the desired features and the client's suggested deadline, a development timeline can now be created. Using the average sprint length of two to four weeks as a basis, the small council will propose milestones spaced out over the course of the timeline. Each milestone will have certain feature sets associated with it, and may even include stretch goals if development is ahead of schedule.

###Consult with Kingsguard on Security

After the program has been designed and discussed thoroughly, the Kingsguard is then consulted on security aspects. The discussion includes who the program is intended for and what features are expected to be implemented. This enables the Lord Commander and the Kingsguard to start looking into possible security vulnerabilities, as well as point out any fatal security flaws that are eminent from the planning and design processes.

Again, this creates a proactive approach to security, enabling the Kingsguard to consider issues before they occur and allowing them to be prepared for the challenge.
