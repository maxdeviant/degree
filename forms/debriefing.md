Debriefing Checklist
=====

The following document is a recommended checklist to follow during post-iteration debriefing sessions. This document may very well evolve over the course of using Stark, and it is a good idea to keep it up to date with the latest personalizations of the process.

Developers are advised to have written down their thoughts on the iteration and come prepared to share. This will speed up debriefing time and make the activity more effective overall.

|#|Topic

1| **What did we do well?** Use this time to discuss the positives of the project. Get them recorded while still fresh in everyones' minds. Go over all aspects of the development process, including planning, deployment (if applicable), and of course, development.
2| **What could be done better?** Use this time to dicuss the detractors of the project. Again, try to record everything while it is still fresh. One key thing to remember is not to turn this into a self-deprecation- or bashing-fest. Be critical, but attempt to channel all criticisms constructively.
3| **What have we learned?** While the previous two listings may border on this, use this time to go over raw specifics on what was learned during the sprint. This could range from implementation details to scaling hardships. Discuss any new techologies that were used and how the team learned to use them more effectively throughout the past few weeks.
4| **What about Stark needs to change?** We recognize that Stark, while well-intentioned, is not a perfect process. As such, time should be taken at the end of each sprint to see if there are any outstanding issues with how Stark fits into the company workflow. Depending on the nature of these issues, Stark may be adjusted accordingly and have the proposed changes carried out in preparation for the next sprint.
