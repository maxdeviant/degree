#6. Design

##1. Plan your work.

Planning should be the first task in every software iteration. The Hand and Small Council meet to pick feature from the backlog to develop for that sprint. The Kingsguard is brought into this discussion to preemptively discuss possible security flaws so that they can be avoided in production. The QA is also involved in the planning stages so they can be aware of what the features should do when it comes to testing them.

##2. Work your plan.

Over a period of two to four weeks, the small council will begin the development process on the features decided upon in planning. The Hand is in charge of monitor the progress that occurs in the development, security, and QA teams and act as liason between them and the King, who reports to management on the project. 

##3. Review your work

Upon arriving at the sprint's end, The Hand, Small Council, Kingsguard, and the client shall reconvene to review the features developed during the sprint. The Small Council will preview the features as they stand, and discuss them with the client. The Kingsguard discusses the work they did in providing security in the features without sacrificing functionality. It is during this period that the client can discuss the backlog and features that haven't been developed. Given the current status of features, and how they are shaping the application, the client may deem some features unnecessary and have them removed from the backlog. They may also decide that, given the way a certain feature operates, that new features need to be added.

##4. Evaluate the plan

After the review of the sprint's fruitions, The Hand, Small Council, and Kingsguard shall discuss the sprint's feature backlog and the last sprint's activities. This is to focus on major improvements that occurred, and how to continue these as well as what didn't go according to plan. The purpose of this meeting is to improve the productivity of the small council as much as possible. This meeting can last anywhere from two to four hours.
