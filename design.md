#6. Design
>"Design is intelligence made visible." â€“ Alina Wheeler

##1. Plan your work.

Planning should be the first task in every software iteration. The Hand and small council meet to pick feature from the backlog to develop for that sprint. The Kingsguard is brought into this discussion to preemptively discuss possible security flaws so that they can be avoided in production. Developers should also be thinking ahead of unit tests that they will need to write to ensure the stability of the final features.

##2. Work your plan.

Over a period of two to four weeks, the small council will begin the development process on the features decided upon in planning. The Hand is in charge of monitoring the progress that occurs in the various development teams, primarily through what is reported via the small council. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard will keep the king informed of the overall security status of the project. All information is relayed to the king, who is then able to provide regular reports to management and clients.

Developers will strive to complete the features assigned to them in a timely fashion. Finishing features early is encouraged, as this provides more time for testing and quality assurance processes. However, it is discouraged that developers take on new features from the backlog, as this can result in a feature creep and even result in missed deadlines.

##3. Review your work

Upon arriving at the sprint's end, the Hand, small council, Kingsguard, and the client shall rconvene to review the features developed during the sprint. The small council will preview the features as they stand, and discuss them with the client. The Kingsguard discusses the work they did in providing security in the features without sacrificing functionality.

It is during this period that the client can discuss the backlog and features that have not been developed yet. Given the current status of features, and how they are shaping the application, the client may deem some features unnecessary and have them removed from the backlog. They may also decide that, given the way a certain feature operates, that new features need to be added.

##4. Evaluate the plan

After the review of the sprint's completed work, the Hand, small council, and Kingsguard shall discuss the sprint's feature backlog and the last sprint's activities. This is to focus on major improvements that occurred, and how to continue these as well as items that did not go according to plan. The purpose of this meeting is to improve the productivity of the small council as much as possible. This meeting can last anywhere from two to four hours.
